# Given 2 strings, a and b, return the number of the positions where they contain the same length 2 substring.

def string_match(a, b):
  # Figure which string is shorter.
  shorter = min(len(a), len(b))
  count = 0
  
  # Loop i over every substring starting spot.
  # Use length-1 here, so can use char str[i+1] in the loop
  for i in range(shorter-1):
    a_sub = a[i:i+2]
    b_sub = b[i:i+2]
    if a_sub == b_sub:
      count = count + 1

  return count
